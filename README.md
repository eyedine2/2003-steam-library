# 2003-steam-library

After I made my 2013 inspired steam library I wanted to go further back. Maybe not for daily use (I find military green to be a sickening color), but for just the fascination I've had for putting old stuff in new stuff. This took just a few hours to make and that's for good reason, I just plain deleted the grid / content view! I mean, it's not like we had that back in 2003, right? (I don't know, I wasn't alive then)

Unfortunately, this means usability in the client is restricted. While at one point the right-click menus used to allow you to go to a game's store page or community hub, now it's been restricted to Collection Management and uninstalling. Lame.  Fortunately, all the "bare essentials" of steam still exist! You can Download, Play, Uninstall, and maybe even kinda sort collections and stuff! Yay! But Steam still sucks up RAM like it's nothing! Boo...

This is intended to be used alongside Ungstein's "OG Steam" skin. Ungstein also made his own library skin but I'm not personally a fan of that because it's a simple re-styling instead of a complete change. And it doesn't even include scrollbars!

To install, you need steamfriendspatcher. Run that, then just drop this skin in the steamui folder. Yep, that simple! No javascript and very low possibility of breaking during an update. Who knew emulating what's basically a 90s interface was so simple?
